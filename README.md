# Impact of Political Shifts on Dining Sentiment  
## An Examination of Yelp Reviews Before and After the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election

## Project Overview
This project examines whether the 2016 U.S. presidential election influenced consumer sentiment expressed in Yelp restaurant reviews. By analyzing review text and ratings before and after the election, this study explores whether a highly polarized political event had spillover effects on everyday consumer behavior.

The analysis focuses on two politically opposite states—California (Democratic stronghold) and Tennessee (Republican stronghold)—to understand how political alignment may correlate with changes in dining sentiment.

## Research Background

### Overview of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election
The 2016 U.S. presidential election was one of the most polarizing elections in modern American history. Donald J. Trump (Republican) defeated Hillary Clinton (Democrat) in the Electoral College by a margin of 306 to 232 votes. Despite this outcome, Clinton won the popular vote with 48.0% (65.9 million votes) compared to Trump’s 45.9% (63 million votes).

The election demonstrated strong party-line loyalty across most states, while a small number of swing states ultimately determined the final outcome.

## State-Level Political Divide
The 2016 election results varied significantly across states, with some regions overwhelmingly supporting one candidate. To understand the broader political divide, we examine two states that represent opposite ends of the political spectrum—California (Democratic stronghold) and Tennessee (Republican stronghold). These states provide a clear contrast in voter preferences and serve as a reference point for analyzing potential sentiment shifts following the election.
